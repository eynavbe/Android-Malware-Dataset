# Android-Malware-Dataset

## branch master - helper code to perform the assignment
The code of the classifier
## branch main - our work
 - ready_secsvm.py - running the classifier according to our needs.
 - attact.py - Running the attacks on the classifier
 - classifier.pkl - the file we created after running the classifier includes the, model, train and test applications - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1isun4OkSsCSciv1CtOPTobnMlY5LP1JP/view?usp=share_link
 - secSVM attack model.pdf - The article that describes the work performed.
 
## The fastest way to run the project:
- Download the file - classifier.pkl, attack.py.
- Opening a terminal linked to the folder where the files are located.
- write in the terminal:
  - conda activate myenv - assuming that the environment on which modules are installed is in myenv (read by this name)
  - python attack.py
